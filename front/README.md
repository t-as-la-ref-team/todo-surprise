## 🛠 Development Server  

To start a local development server, run:  

```bash
ng serve
```
Once running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will **auto-reload** whenever you modify any source files.

---

## 🚀 Building  

To build the project, run:  
```bash
ng build
```
This will compile the project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. The production build optimizes performance.

---

## 🧪 Running Tests  

### Unit Tests  
Execute unit tests using the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner:  
```bash
ng test
```

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests  
For E2E testing, run:  
```bash
ng e2e
```
Angular CLI does not include an E2E testing framework by default, so you can choose one that suits your project.
